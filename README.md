# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project

This is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification. This is my  first project, so I decided to do the entire case study using Microsoft Excel.

### What is the business task?
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. The director of marketing wants better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

### Description of all data sources used
The data can be found on divvy bicycle sharing services website. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. The data is organized monthly in excel sheets.
